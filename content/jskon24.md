## The Event

First of all, I want to thank the **Istanbul JavaScript Community** for organizing such a great event, and I want to thank all the speakers, sponsors, and participants for making this event possible. It was a great event, I had a lot of fun and learned a lot of new things.

## The Talks

There were many speakers from different fields of JavaScript. We attended two particularly insightful talks: **Core of Node.js** by [Emre Yalvaç](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emreyalvac) and **Mobile development with Capacitor** by [Vatanay Özbeyli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vatanay/).

Emre Yalvaç talked about **libuv**. Libuv is a c library to abstract non-blocking I/O operations. His presentation provided deep insights into how Node.js I/O works under the hood.

Vatanay Özbeyli talked about **Capacitor**, showcasing a live coding demo on creating and running a Capacitor project. Despite the limited time, he used his time effectively and highlighted valuable keypoints.

## Quiz Game from Teknasyon

One of the event highlights was a quiz game organized by [Teknasyon](https://teknasyon.com/tech), one of the sponsors. They asked questions about Javascript. I answered a question about how to create a empty object in JavaScript correctly and won a **water bottle**. It was a fun experience, and I want to thank Teknasyon for the gifts and the enjoyable quiz game.
