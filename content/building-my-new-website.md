## Why did I decide to build a new website?

I have been using my old website for a long time. It was built with Next.js and custom CSS. I liked the design when I first built it, but now it feels outdated. Also, I built that website to show off CSS animations and transitions, so if the user goes to my website, they will see any content after ~1 second of animation. That was cool at that time, but now I feel like it's not user-friendly. So I decided to build a new website with a new design and new technologies.

## Choosing the right technologies

I used to develop my projects using **React**, so that's why I used Next.js for my old website. But since then I learned a lot about **Vue.js** and I like it. So I decided to build my new website with **Nuxt.js**. Also, I am a big fan of **Tailwind CSS**, I've been using it in my projects for a while now. So I decided to use Tailwind CSS for my new website. And you might ask how I am writing this blog post. I'm using **Markdown** for writing my blog posts. Thanks to the **@nuxt/content** module, I can write my blog posts in markdown and it will be converted to HTML.

## Designing the website

I'm not a designer, but I love to create designs for my own projects. This time I wanted to keep it simple and sharp. I just wanted users who visit my website to see my details, experiences, and projects directly when they visit my website. So I removed all the animations and transitions, all the unnecessary stuff.

After a few hours of designing, I came up with this design:

::c-image{src="/content/new-design.png" alt="New design of my website"}
::

I liked the design, it was simple and clean. It shows my most recent experiences directly to the user. I started to code the design after that.

## Developing the website

I don't want to bore you with codes, so I will not go into too much detail about coding the website, if you are interested you can check the source code of this website on [GitHub](https://github.com/woxedev/woxedev) or you can ask me anything on [X](https://twitter.com/woxedev).

When I look back, it took me one night to code the website. As I said before, I used Nuxt.js and Tailwind CSS for the website. I also used the **@nuxt/content** module for writing blog posts. I liked developing the website with Nuxt.js, it was really easy to use.

## Conclusion

I'm happy with the new design and the tech stack. I hope you like it too. If you have any feedback or questions, reach out to me on [X](https://twitter.com/woxedev).
